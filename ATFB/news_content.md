We are aware of an issue with Roughly Enough Items where only a handful of items are showing up in-game. This issue has been identified as being caused by the version of REI shipped with v5.10.0. We will release a new build, v5.11.0, as soon as possible to fix this.

In the meantime, you can manually update the mod to version v12.1.7.80 from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei/version/Lg9Hl5NP).

Additionally, we are removing Fabricae Ex Nihilo due to server performance issues that have arisen.
