We are aware of an issue with Roughly Enough Items where only a handful of items are showing up in-game. We have identified that this issue is due to the version of REI shipped with v5.11.0 and will push a .1 update out as soon as possible to fix this. In the meantime, you can manually update the mod to version v12.1.7.80 from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei/version/Lg9Hl5NP).
