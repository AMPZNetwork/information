# Claiming Land on the official All the Forge Server

You can claim up to 300k blocks volume on the Server.
This claiming considers X and Z locations, but also Y (height).

## How To
### 1. Select an area
Select your area with the commands `//pos1` and `//pos2`.
Remember to consider height! Your roof or basement may not get included in the claim if you only claim from the normal ground.
### 2. Choose a name for your area
Names must be unique between all players, and you might want to consider something other than "home" since you'll be able to set a warp location for your home.
### 3. Claim the area
This is done with the command `/rg claim <name>`, and that will be it already!

## Viewing and Modifying claim settings
While standing inside your claim, you can use `/rg info` to show information about it.
The menu in chat can be clicked, you can also explore the `[Flags]` menu and maybe set a `teleport` location, which players can use to teleport to your claim with `/rg tp <name>`
You are also able to edit Members of the claim here to give access to your friends.

## Larger Claims
If the claim limit does not suffice your building plans, you can always ask staff to claim a larger area for you.
