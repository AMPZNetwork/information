**Server Rollback Notification**

We've had to revert our server world back to its state from two days ago. This action was necessary due to an oversight on LabsZero's part, resulting in certain parts of the map becoming corrupted. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Thank you for your understanding.
