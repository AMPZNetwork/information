      "question": "Changing the server RAM amount?",
      "answer": "Adjusting the amount of memory (RAM) your server uses is quite simple. Open the `user_jvm_args.txt` file, locate the line that contains `-Xmx4G`, and change the number to reflect the amount of RAM you need. For instance, if you want to allocate 8GB of RAM, you would change `-Xmx4G` to `-Xmx8G`. Please note that this only applies to self-hosted servers. If you are using a hosting provider, you will need to pay to upgrade your server memory. Also, this does not apply to our Fabric server files. For information on adjusting RAM for All The Fabric, please refer to the next paragraph. <br><br>To adjust the amount of RAM your server can use with our Fabric server files, you need to open the `server-setup-config.yaml`. After that, navigate to `maxRam: 3G` and change 3GB to your desired amount."
