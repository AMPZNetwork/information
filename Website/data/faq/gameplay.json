      "answer": "Adjusting the RAM allocated to your server is simple. Open `user_jvm_args.txt`, locate the line containing `-Xmx4G`, and change the number to reflect your desired RAM amount.

For Fabric server files, open the `server-setup-config.yaml`, find the line `maxRam: 3G`, and change it to your desired RAM amount."
